i'm here. We will try to understand how RNN and a long short term memory works. 

first of all today I learned that, indeed, sigmoid is the main activation function for binary classification

And so if Max is actually an excavation function for multi class classification. 
We need to learn more about how to work with KL divergence. Great exercise was provided on the midterm. We should learn that.

Second important thing is it's important to combine Chad gpt with the actual knowledge of pytorch and that's how we will succeed
